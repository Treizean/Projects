            <h2>Project 1: Impact-of-Age-on-Crime-Victimization</h2>
            <p>This is a closer look at the CMPD Dataset using a comparison of age on crime victimization</p>

                <p>Detailed description: Different age groups experience different types of crimes. Young people often face violent crimes, while older people are more likely to experience property crimes. These patterns can vary based on factors like location and income. Understanding these crime patterns is crucial for creating better strategies to prevent crime, support victims, and address the significant impact of fear on community behavior and lifestyle choices. </p>

            <h2>Project 2: Classification Model on Yahoo Finance Dataset</h2>
            <p>This is a classification model on the stock market to predict whether a stock’s price will go up or down (or stay the same) based on historical data.</p>

            <div class="details" id="details2">
                <p>Detailed description: This project aims to build a machine-learning classification model to predict stock market movements (e.g., whether a stock’s price will go up or down). It involves collecting historical stock data (prices, volumes, and technical indicators), performing feature engineering (e.g., calculating moving averages, RSI), and preprocessing the data for modeling. A classification algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) is then trained to predict future price changes based on past patterns. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision, followed by backtesting to simulate real-world conditions. The goal is to create a predictive model that aids in stock market decision-making.</p>
